## How It Works

### Message Encoding & Decoding

The bot uses a unique encoding system that can hide messages of any length within emojis or characters:

- **Single Emoji Encoding**: An entire message, regardless of length, can be encoded into a single emoji. This makes it perfect for hiding long messages in seemingly innocent emojis.
  ```
  "Hello, this is a secret message!" â†’ "ðŸ˜€" (encoded)
  "ðŸ˜€" â†’ "Hello, this is a secret message!" (decoded)
  ```

- **Character-Based Encoding**: Messages can also be encoded into regular alphabet letters, making them appear as normal text.
  ```
  "Top secret information" â†’ "a" (encoded)
  "a" â†’ "Top secret information" (decoded)
  ```

- **Multiple Character Support**: The encoding system supports:
  - All standard text characters
  - Special characters
  - Numbers
  - Emojis
  - Unicode characters

- **Stealth Communication**: Perfect for sending hidden messages that look like regular emojis or text in any chat platform.
